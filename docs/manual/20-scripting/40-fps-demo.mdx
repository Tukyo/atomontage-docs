# FPS Demo

The first person shooter demo is a multiplayer game example that you can use as a reference and base for your own games.

![](/img/fps/fpsTeaser.gif)

It contains:
* Player controller with a first person camera
* Support for keyboard + mouse and mobile touch input via buttons and joysticks
* A player character dynamically generated from randomized shapes with look and walk animations
* Simple physics system
* Health system
* Building system
* Inventory system with various items the players can use such as guns, paint, etc


## Running the demo

* In server hierarchy locate the `FPS Game` prefab set the object active
* You should now be in first person mode, press `F2` to return to the editor
* Find the `Spawn Points` object in the server hierarchy and position its child to adjust your spawn point
* You can add multiple spawn points to randomize the spawn location

* `RTYUIOP[}GHJKL:"|` - Spawn various items
* `V` - Teleport up

## Adding a Tool or Weapon

![](/img/fps/addItem.png)


* Find the `Item Prefabs` object
* Select one of the exsiting items and duplicate it (`Ctrl + D`)
* Replace the item script with your own
* The script must start with `Item` to be recognized as a usable item i.e. `Item Laser Gun` otherwise it will be a building item
* After reloading you can now spawn the item using one of the spawn cheat keys mentioned above 

This is an example item script. All function defined in this script are automatically called by the user of the item on client and server.
Start by making something happen in `self:primaryDown(id)`

```lua title="Item Example.lua"
--@class ItemExample:Item
local self = {}

---@type number|nil nil if held by non human player
self.ownerID = nil
---@type Object
self.user = nil
---@type Object
self.aimFrom = nil

function self:Attach()
    self.component.syncToClients = true
end

function self:Start()

end

function self:Update(deltaTime)

end


--this and other item functions are called on server and owner client
function self:onStartHolding(id, user, aimFrom)
    self.ownerID = id
    self.user = user
    self.aimFrom = aimFrom
end

function self:onStopHolding()
    self.ownerID = nil
    self.user = nil
    self.aimFrom = nil
end

function self:primaryDown(id)
    
end

function self:primaryHeld(id)

end

function self:primaryUp(id)
    
end

function self:secondaryDown(id)
    
end

function self:secondaryHeld(id)

end

function self:secondaryUp(id)
    
end


return self
```

## Adding a Voxel Scene

You can add some voxel scenes such as the various Islands you will find in your assets. 
You can also [voxelize your own](../getting-started/importing-meshes) or use the shape tools to build your own scene.

* Use the `Add Asset` button to add a voxel scene
* Disable `Copy on Write` to avoid the voxel scene loading on first edit, if you have the scene more than once edits will be shared however
