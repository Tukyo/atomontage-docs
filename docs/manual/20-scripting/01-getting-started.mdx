## Lua
Lua is the scripting language used in Atomontage. A good resource to learn Lua is [Learn Lua in 5 minutes](https://gist.github.com/roalcantara/49de782ab32385db78357192e6750c8e) 

## Lua Basics

Lua keeps things simple. There are only a handful of types, everything else is built on top and chats with our APIs:

- **nil** → absence of a value  
- **boolean** → `true` or `false`  
- **number** → all numbers (integers + floats)  
- **string** → text values  
- **table** → the *only* data structure (works as arrays, dictionaries, or objects)  
- **function** → first-class functions you can assign, pass around, and call  

### Examples
```lua
local x = 10           -- number
local name = "Cortex"    -- string
local isActive = true  -- boolean
local nothing = nil    -- nil
local list = {1, 2, 3} -- table as array
local user = {name = "Data", age = 25} -- table as dictionary

function greet(person)
  print("Hello " .. person)
end

greet(user.name) -- Hello Data
