# Scene
The scene contains multiple elements. Most notably, the static and dynamic voxel scenes.

## Voxel Scene Static
The static voxel scene is composed of non-moving elements. Voxels in this scene can be added directly, or stamped from objects. Objects from the dynamic scene are added to the static scene voxels when they become non-dynamic.

### Components
- [`Static Voxel Data`](/api/StaticVoxelData) 
- [`Voxel Renderer`](/api/VoxelRenderer)

## Voxel Scene Dynamic
The dynamic voxel scene includes moving elements, such as characters, vehicles, and interactive objects. These elements can change position, shape, and appearance during gameplay.

### Components
- [`Voxel Data`](/api/VoxelData) 
- [`Voxel Renderer`](/api/VoxelRenderer)

For more info, see the [Voxels](/manual/editor/basics/voxels) page.

## Scene Options
### Visual
