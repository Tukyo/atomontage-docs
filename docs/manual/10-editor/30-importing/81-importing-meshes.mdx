# Importing Meshes

You can voxelize single `fbx`, `obj` or `glb` files by dropping them onto your client. You can also drop a `zip` containing multiple files that belong together.
This voxelization currently uses default paramters for voxel resolution, voxelization method and baked lighting. 

To change these parameters programmatically, you can see the `voxelizeMeshUrl` function in the `Voxelizer.lua` script for an example which uses our voxelizer api.
